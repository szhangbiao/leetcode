## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

## Description

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

## Solution

 What we could do is to record the numbers we have traversed and the relevant index with a Map. Whenever we meet a new number during traversal, we go back to the Map and check whether the `diff` between this number and the target number appeared before. If it did, the problem has been solved and there's no need to continue.

## Key Points

- Find the difference instead of the sum
- Connect every number with its index through the help of Map
- Less time by more space. Reduce the time complexity from O(N) to O(1)

## Code

- Support Language: cpp

```cpp
/*
 * @lc app=leetcode id=1 lang=cpp
 *
 * [1] Two Sum
 */

// @lc code=start
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> indices;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)
        {
            if (indices.find(target - nums[i]) != indices.end())
            {
                return {indices[target - nums[i]], i};
            }
            indices[nums[i]] = i;
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```
